# Contributing to Sveltia CMS

## Bug reports

Since Sveltia CMS is still in beta, we expect various problems. Please [report any bugs to us](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/new?labels=bug) so we can make it better for everyone.

## Code contributions

Due to limited review resources and the ongoing technical upgrades across the codebase, pull requests will not be accepted for the time being, except for trivial changes. Please file issues instead. We plan to create contributor documents after the 1.0 release.

## Localizations

As we get closer to the 1.0 release, we’ll be welcoming [localizers](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/blob/main/src/lib/locales/README.md).

## Donations

Tips are always welcome! The project hasn’t set up a sponsorship program, but maintainer [@kyoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino) has a [PayPal account](https://paypal.me/kohei).

## Other things you can do

Last but not least, don’t forget to star this project on GitHub and spread the word so more users can benefit from a better CMS experience!
