# Sveltia CMS

[Sveltia CMS](https://sveltiacms.app/en/) is a Git-based headless CMS under active development as a modern, direct [replacement for Netlify CMS and Decap CMS](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/successor-to-netlify-cms). We have solved hundreds of issues reported in the predecessor’s repository, ranging from critical bugs to top feature requests, while maintaining high compatibility.

Built from the ground up, Sveltia CMS offers excellent UX, DX, performance, security and internationalization (i18n) support. Although some features are still missing, our numerous enhancements ensure smooth daily workflows for content editors and developers alike.

This free, open-source successor to Netlify CMS is currently in public beta, with version 1.0 expected in early 2026. Check out the [Release Notes](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/releases) for the latest updates.

Despite its beta status, more and more sites are [switching from Netlify/Decap CMS](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/migration/netlify-decap-cms) to Sveltia CMS. It’s already being used in production by hundreds of individuals and organizations worldwide. See our [Showcase](https://sveltiacms.app/en/showcase) for examples.
