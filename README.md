# Sveltia CMS

[Sveltia CMS](https://sveltiacms.app/en/) is a Git-based lightweight headless CMS under active development as a modern, powerful, direct replacement for Netlify CMS (now Decap CMS). We have picked up where they left off and have already solved hundreds of issues reported in the predecessor’s repository, ranging from critical bugs to top feature requests.

Built from the ground up, Sveltia CMS offers excellent UX, DX, performance, security and internationalization (i18n) support. Although some features are still missing, our numerous enhancements across the board ensure smooth daily workflows for content editors and developers alike.

This free, open source [successor to Netlify/Decap CMS](https://sveltiacms.app/en/docs/successor-to-netlify-cms) is currently in public beta, with version 1.0 expected in early 2026. Despite the beta status, more and more people are switching to Sveltia CMS every day. It’s already being used in production by hundreds of individuals and organizations worldwide.
