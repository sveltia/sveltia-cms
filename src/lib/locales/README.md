# Localizing Sveltia CMS

Thank you for your interest in translating the Sveltia CMS user interface! While we’re happy to have you on board, these strings are not yet ready for localization.

- Most of the strings are unorganized or unpolished.
- Some strings are difficult to translate without context.
- Many strings, including configuration error messages and invisible labels for screen readers, will be added before the 1.0 release as we implement more missing features.
- We are migrating from [svelte-i18n](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-i18n) to the new [MessageFormat 2](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg)-based sveltia-i18n library to better handle singular/plural forms and even more complex grammars.
- The existing Japanese localization is provided for the [maintainer](https://github.com/kyoshino)’s Japanese clients.

If your language is not yet on the [waiting list](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/labels/l10n) and you’d like to localize the app, feel free to [file a new issue](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues/new?labels=l10n) so we can ping you when it’s ready!
